"""
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest
palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
"""

"""
We check for pairs of numbers between 900 and 999 if their product is a
palindrome. After collecting all palindromes, we determine the maximum
and that is our solution.
