"""
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below,
the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

   3
  7 4
 2 4 6
8 5 9 3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route.
However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows;
it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)
"""

"""
We solve this problem by brute-forcing and Problem 67 with a clever method,
so we'll have seen both ways. Note that this way is not efficient because
to find the max path it is not necessary to try every route. 

We implement the brute-force way with a recursive method. We start from the
root at the top and compute the paths left and right seperately. We add the
number of this paths and get the max from them. The recursive calls compute
the max of the paths there and return it.
