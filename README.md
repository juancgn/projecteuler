Project Euler is a series of very interesting mathematical and programming problems that you can find [here](https://projecteuler.net/). The problems are designed to be solved with computational power, however, mathematical skills are necessary to find an elegant and efficient way to solve them in suitable time. When providing the correct answer, you get access to the forum for this particular problem and can discuss it, read the code of others or provide your own code for others. The problems are often from number theory.

I don't have much to do with number theory and that's why it's particular interesting for me because I learn a lot. My goal was to start from the beginning and solve the problems now and then when I have time. I also want to provide not only the solution but also rich explanations, proofs and comments so that interested people can follow my thoughts.

Have fun!
